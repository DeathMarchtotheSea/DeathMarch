Bylaws
======

Herein lie the bylaws of the Death March.

Preamble
========

We the members of the Death March to the Sea, in order to punish our bodies, but also to strengthen and test our friendships, do ordain and establish a yearly trek held in the hottest days of summer from Reseda Boulevard to the Pacific Ocean.

Bylaws
======

The bylaws are the official rules of the Death March.

Any change to the bylaws must be voted upon and radified with high fives by a triumvirate of Officers. Anytime a triumvirate of officers meet in person, they must pass, amend, fix, modify, or semantically adjust a bylaw.

Term
====

The Death March will be held yearly until someone actually dies on the March.

Each Death March begins with a speech from the Grand Marshal and ends when everyone touches the ocean.

Date
====

The March must be held in the summer. The Death March shall never occur in another season.

The Grand Marshal is responsible for coordinating with others to plan a date. This date must be agreed upon by a triumvirate of ranking members of the Death March.

If by August 20th, the Grand Marshal has not solidified a date for the Death March, the Lieutenant Marshal must schedule the March as soon as possible with or without the consent of the Grand Marshal. If no march has been scheduled by September 1st, any ranking officer of the March may schedule a date.

If the March is not held by the Autumnal Equinox, the line of succession is broken and these bylaws will cease to be in force. A new charter must be drawn after that.

Once the date of the Death March has been determined, the current winning team must choose a theme within one month. Failure to do so will result in the privilege of choosing the theme passing to the team of the Premiere. The Premiere’s team then has one month to pick a theme. Failure to do so will result in the privilege passing to the Grand Marshal. If the Death March occurs before any of these deadlines, the day before the Death March shall become the deadline.

The First to the Sea Challenge only begins once the Grand Marshal announces it at Eagle Rock.

Rank
====

Rank is determined by number of rank points a person holds. Points are calculated at the Banquet.

Completed Official Marches
--------------------------

Three (3) rank points are earned for any completed march.


Absentee Marches
----------------

Absentee Marches are marches undertaken to make up for not being able to attend the March. They must be at least as long as the Death March in miles. Absentee Marches are based on trust, but must be approved by the Grand Marshal. Approved Absentee Marches are worth two (2) rank points, restore one to the list of ranking member, and confer any titles earned for Punishments undertaken on the Absentee March. Anyone who attends an Absentee March for support cannot be stripped of titles for not performing punishments earned on an official March, but it is considered bad form to do so.

Members who earned rank points on the Official March for the year cannot earn any more points. Members who failed to complete the Official March may go on an Absentee March that year to receive two (2) points for the year.

Incomplete Marches
------------------

Individuals who do not complete a March for any reason will only receive two (2) rank points.

Missed Marches
--------------

One is removed from the ranking members list if they miss a march.

Ties
----

Any ties in rank points can then be further determined by the following criteria:

1. Anyone who is late to a March immediately loses any ties for the year
2. Anyone with more Total Complete Official Marches wins any further ties
3. More Recent Consecutive Complete Official Marches are used to break any further ties
4. If any ties remain, rock-paper-scissors is used to determine appropriate ranking


Catch-up Marches
----------------

If someone arrives late to the March, but catches-up with any of the initial marching members before the last one touches the Ocean, this person is fully eligible to finish the march as if they had begun it with the rest of the members. They are, however, still subject to losing ties due to being late.

Drivers
-------

Anyone who helps shuttle people between the Palisades and Reseda is entitled to one (1) extra rank point for their dedication to the cause.

Point Decay
-----------

Rank points decay exponentially at a rate of -0.25. Decay calculations are calculated by year, so the date during the year at which one does a Death March or Absentee March does not enter into the calculation.

Officers
========
Officers are the leaders of the Death March. No one person can hold more than one officership, with the exception of Vanguard.  One may decline any officership. Marshal positions are then passed on to the next eligible ranking member until the next point evaluation. If the Captain of the largest team declines the Premiere position, that team must elect another team member to be the Premiere. Once declined, a position may not be regained until the next March.

Grand Marshal
-------------

The Grand Marshal of the Death March is the leader of the Death March. The Grand Marshal has the final say into all matters March related that are not outlined in the bylaws. The Grand Marshal is also responsible for clarifying the laws. However, the Grand Marshal cannot change existing Bylaws or create new Bylaws without due process. 

Lieutenant Marshal
------------------

Lieutenant Marshal is responsible for all the mundane details like recording the bylaws, inviting people, and securing transportation. This title is given to whoever may have the second highest rank.

Vice Lieutenant Marshal
-----------------------

The Vice Lieutenant Marshal is the manager of the Punishments. They are responsible for the planning and implemention of Punishments. This title is given to whoever may have the third highest rank.

Premiere
--------

The Premiere is the leader of the largest team to finish the Death March. If more than one team is tied for most amount of people, the leaders of those teams will agree to a competitive game and the winner of said game will become the Premiere.

The Premiere has full voting and nominating privileges.

Chancellors
-----------

Chancellors are the leaders of the various support corps of the Death March. A Chancellor can be nominated by any Marshal. Upon confirmation by the other two Marshals, the Chancellor gains a title such as "Chancellor of Transportation" or "Chancellor of Banquets."They will hold this office until they resign, miss a march, or are stripped of their title by a triumvirate of officers.

Chancellors are not considered full Officers for voting purposes, however a majority vote of current Chancellors can equal the vote of one Officer. 

Vanguard
--------

Vanguard of the Death March is given to the one who has the most seminal involvement in the formation of the Death March.

Teams
=====
In order to increase group spirit in an ever growing event, teams are a group of Marchers who share a common goal of finishing the Death March together. 

Team Formation
--------------
Anyone who can provide transportation at the end of a March from the Palisades back to the start is eligible to be a team captain. Each team member must swear or affirm loyalty to the team in a manner decided by the team captain.

Team Size
---------
A team may only be as big as the transportation the captain can provide. If more than one team captain wants to form a common team, they must choose amongst themselves who will be the captain. Anyone who drives but does not become a captain will be known as a ranger. A team must consist of 2 or more people.

Team Flair
----------
All teams may choose a name, team colors, and a mascot.

Team Completion
---------------
A team completes the March when the last member of the team touches the ocean. The first complete team to finish the March will be responsible for assigning a theme and/or subtitle to the next year's March. A team will only be recognized for the year if all the team members make it back from the ocean with the team captain or team rangers.

Lack of a Team
--------------
Any one who voluntarily Marches without team affiliation takes full personal responsibility for getting back to from the ocean on their own.

The Punishments
===============

Punishments are things one does to make the Death March more deadly. By participating in a punishment, you are conferred a title. The titles and specifics are listed below. It should be noted that no one has to perform the task stated, but they will not receive, or they will be stripped of, the corresponding title.

Personal Punishments
--------------------

Members may elect to take on personal punishments to show their devotion to the cause.

A single personal punishment will be approved by the Marshals at the end of a march. A second personal punishment will be approved by the members at the end of the March. Upon approval, the approved personal punishment becomes an Official Punishment for the next year. The title of the punishment will then be put up for debate. If a triumvirate of Officers is unable to agree upon a title, the title originally used when a personal punishment will remain.

Alcohol Consumption Punishment
------------------------------

The Protectorship of a Spanish-speaking Latin American country is the title received by consuming alcohol at some point on the march. Protectorship may be lost if one fails to (1) imbibe alcohol at some point on the march before touching the ocean, or (2) attend the most recent march at all. The unprotected country may then be assumed by another attendee.

Tommy's Chili Punishment
------------------------

Honorifics such as Sir, Doctor, Captain, Sama, Lady, and Master, among others, are applied based on the consumption of a chili-topped food product from Tommy's. Anyone who achieves this title and then misses a march is demoted to a Lord/Lady-in-waiting. If two consecutive marches are missed, this title will be stripped completely.

Squire (or other appropriate diminutive title) is applied to people who are deemed to have not fully earned their honorific. This can be due to not consuming enough chili-topped food product.

Labours Punishment
------------------

At the beginning of the March, all participants must draw five (5) cards from an unmodified deck of standard playing cards held by the Vice Lieutenant Marshal. The values of these cards must be recorded in the order they are drawn. Face cards count for ten (10), and aces count for one (1) or eleven (11), depending on participant preference stated when cards are first drawn. One must choose aces as eleven (11) to be considered for Overlord Status (*see below*). Cards are returned to the deck after being drawn and recorded. The total value of these cards is used to determine how many Labours (repetitions of a given exercise) must be Endured (*i.e.* performed) under the following circumstances.

###3S

Credit for Enduring Labours is handled through the 3S (**S**tars and **S**tatus **S**ystem). For each card value that is satisfied through Labours, a participant earns one (1) star. Earning those stars through various conditions will earn the participant a Status, such as Redeemer, Saint, or Overlord.

###Stop Types

There are three types of stops:

1.    A Scheduled Stop is an officially sanctioned (by the Grand Marshal) rest stop for the March, such as Musch Camp or Eagle Rock.

2.    An Unscheduled Stop is an unsanctioned stop for the purposes of resting.

3.    A Mercy Stop is a stop made by one participant to accompany one or more participants who are themselves making an Unscheduled Stop, or to wait for one or more participants who are lagging behind.

4.    A Spiritual Stop is a stop made by a group of participants who are stopping together for the purposes of basking in some sort of Wonder.

At **every** stop, all participants involved **must** Maintain (*see below*) in order to not lose Stars and Status.

###Labours

Labours are repetitions of a given exercise, such as push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, etc., that are to be Endured at all stops. Any kind of Labour may be chosen at any given stop, but only that single type may be Endured at the stop. For instance, one may not do a combination of jumping jacks and push-ups at a single stop – just one or the other.

###Maintaining

The action of Maintaining refers to the retaining of Stars and Status. On all stops, one must Endure at least their first card's value of Labours in order to not lose one's Stars and Status.

###Stars

Credit for Labours is expressed through Stars is earned based on how many card values are satisfied by the number of repetitions of the Labour, taken in the order of the cards drawn. For instance, Ace draws a seven (7), nine (9), five (5), Jack (10), and King (10). In order to earn Five Stars, he must Endure 7 + 9 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 41 Labours. If he only Endures sixteen (16) Labours, he only earns two (2) Stars. Partial stars do not count, so enduring 20 Labours will still only earn two (2) Stars. Maintaining would be equivalent to enduring the first card, or 7 Labours.

###Increasing Star Level

In order to increase one's level of Stars to get closer or equal to their current maximum, a participant needs to Endure Labours from scratch at a Scheduled Stop to satisfy the amount of Stars necessary. For instance, using Ace's example cards above, say he only Endured sixteen (16) Labours and thus earned two (2) Stars out of his maximum of five (5). In order to increase to three (3) Stars, he would have to Endure twenty-one (21) Labours at once.

###Increasing Maximum Star Level

Any participant may attempt to increase their maximum level of Stars by Enduring Labours equal to all of their current cards. Note that this must be done in the presence of the Vice Lieutenant Marshal. Once they Endure these Labours, they are allowed to draw up to five (5) more cards from the deck. At that point, the participant must Endure Labours equal to **all** of those extra cards immediately or they will lose all Stars and Status. If all the Labours are Endured, the participant's Stars and maximum level of Stars is increased by the number of extra cards that were drawn. Note that this new maximum is what must be met from that point on if the participant wishes to further increase their maximum level of Stars. A participant may only ask for a maximum of five (5) extra cards per stop. Additionally, if one requests this of the Vice Lieutenant Marshal at any point other than a Scheduled Stop, it still counts as an Unscheduled Stop for the requester. This stop also counts as a Mercy stop for the Vice Lieutenant Marshal with automatic Maintaining requiring no Labours to be Endured other than supervising the attempt.

###Status

Statuses accompany Stars earned. If at any kind of Stop a participant does not Maintain, they lose their Stars and Status.

The Status of **Redeemer** may be attained by enduring Labours from scratch such that they earn at least one (1) Star and Maintain throughout the rest of the March, either:

1.    At an Unscheduled Stop
2.    After losing Stars and Status

The Status of **Saint** may be attained by two different ways:

1.    A participant must Endure or Maintain during a Mercy Stop
2.    A participant must Endure or Maintain at every Scheduled Stop throughout the March

In either case, a failure to Maintain at any stop will cause the loss of the Saint Status. Also, any Saint who makes an Unscheduled Stop will lose the Saint Status, whether they Maintain or not. Upon such a loss, the Saint Status may not be earned again for the current year's March (Redeemer Status can be earned, however).

The Status of **Overlord** may be attained when both of the following conditions are met:

1.    During a Scheduled Stop, the participant Endures Labours equal to all of his or her current cards
2.    At least one cards in his or her queue is an ace
3.    All aces present in their cards are valued at eleven (11)

The Status of Overlord overrides the Status of Saint once attained, and like the Status of Saint, requires the participant to Maintain and not make Unscheduled Stops in order to keep the Status. Upon loss of the Status of Overlord, it may not be earned again for the current year's March (Redeemer Status can be earned. Saint Status may still be earned if not yet disqualified by making any Unscheduled Stops and not Maintaining, however).

Flagbearing Punishment
----------------------

Anyone who brings a large flag approved by the Grand Marshal and carries it for the duration of the march shall earn the Flagbearer title.

Vegetarianism Punishment
------------------------

Anyone who consumes vegetarian chili in lieu of the Tommy's Chili Punishment and does not eat meat for the entirety of the March shall earn membership into the Fraternity of an animal of their choice. This animal must be an animal that is normally bred for human consumption. The word used in the title for that animal should be a noble word rather than a common word. For example, rather than "pig" one could use "boar" or "Sus Scrofa." 

Noisemaking Punishment
----------------------
Anyone who brings a noise maker approved by the Grand Marshal and uses it often for the duration of the March shall earn the **Troubadour** title.

Marching in Drag Punishment
---------------------------
Any man who dresses in clothing traditionally worn by women, or any woman who dresses in clothing traditionally worn by men and sports facial hair, for the duration of the March shall earn a title with the word **drag** in it.

The Achievements
================

Achievements can be completed for fun. They serve no purpose other than to provide bragging rights for having completed Achievements. An Achievement is a minor feat, defined henceforth in the Bylaws, that is completed by a Marcher during the course of any annual main-event Death March.

Achievements are set apart from Punishments in that no title, prize, office, or power are bestowed upon having completed any or all Achievements; they are only made for fun and bragging rights. While Punishments must be completed annually, any given Achievement must only be completed once for any given Marcher to permanently earn credit for it.

A given Achievement must have been published in the Bylaws by the start of a March for anyone to earn credit for having completed it on that March. This is to prevent new Achievements from being developed mid-hike, thus potentially preventing some Marchers from knowing about and thus completing it, and also to prevent Marchers from earning Achievements for having unwittingly completed a task on a previous year that there was no Achievement for at that time.

Since there is nothing to be gained from completing Achievements, an unlimited number of them can be published to the Bylaws each year. That being said, note that Achievements, being published into the Bylaws, must be Rad-ified to be valid.
