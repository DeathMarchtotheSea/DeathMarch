Bylaws
======

Herein lie the bylaws of the Death March.

Preamble
========

We the members of the Death March to the Sea, in order to punish our bodies, but also to strengthen and test our friendships, do ordain and establish a yearly trek held in the hottest days of summer from Reseda Boulevard to the Pacific Ocean.

Bylaws
======

The bylaws are the official rules of the Death March.

Any change to the bylaws must be voted upon and approved by a triumvirate of Officers.

Term
====

The Death March will be held yearly until someone actually dies on the March.

Each Death March begins with a speech from the Grand Marshal and ends when everyone touches the ocean.

Date
====

The March must be held in the summer. No March shall ever occur in another season.

The Grand Marshal is responsible for coordinating with others to plan a date. This date must be agreed upon by a triumvirate of ranking members of the Death March.

If by August 20th, the Grand Marshal has not solidified a date for the Death March, the Lieutenant Marshal must schedule the March as soon as possible with or without the consent of the Grand Marshal. If no march has been scheduled by September 1st, any ranking officer of the March may schedule a date.

If the March is not held by the Autumnal Equinox, the line of succession is broken and these bylaws will cease to be in force. A new charter must be drawn after that.

Rank
====

Rank is determined by number of rank points a person holds.

Completed Official Marches
--------------------------

Four (4) rank points are earned for any completed march.

Incomplete Marches
------------------

Individuals who do not complete a March for any reason will only receive two (2) rank points.

Missed Marches
--------------

One is removed from the ranking members list if they miss a march.

Ties
----

Any ties in rank points can then be further determined by the following criteria. Any one with more total complete official marches out ranks someone who has less. Recent consecutive complete official marches are used to break any further ties. If any ties remain, rock-paper-scissors is used to determine appropriate ranking.

Latest Member Penalty
---------------------

The last person to arrive at the meeting place or to join the march 30 minutes after the official starting time will be penalized one (1) rank point, therefore earning only three (3) points for a completed March or only one (1) point if they do not complete the March.

Catch-up Marches
----------------

If someone arrives late to the Death March, but then catches-up with any of the initial marching members, this person is fully eligible to finish the march as if they had begun it with the rest of the members as long as they finish before the last finishing member touches the Ocean. They will, however, still be subject to the latest member penalty.

Absentee Marches
----------------

Absentee Marches are marches undertaken to make up for not being able to attend a Death March. They must be at least as long as the Death March in miles and must occur during the summer. Absentee Marches are based on trust, but must be approved by the Grand Marshal. Approved Absentee Marches are worth two (2) rank points, restore one to the list of ranking officers, and confer any titles earned for Punishments undertaken on the Absentee March. Anyone who attends an Absentee March for support cannot be stripped of titles for not performing punishments earned on an official March, but it is considered bad form to do so.

Officers who earned four (4) rank points for the year cannot earn any more points. Officers who did not complete the Official March may go on an Absentee March that year to receive one (1) extra point for a total of three (3) for the year. Officers who earned three (3) rank points for the year due to the Latest Member Penalty may go on an Absentee March that year to reveive one (1) extra point for a total of four (4) for the year.

Officers
========

Grand Marshal
-------------

The Grand Marshal of the Death March is the leader of the Death March. He has the final say into all matters March related that are not outlined in the bylaws. He is also responsible for clarifying the laws. This title is given to whoever may have the highest rank.

Lieutenant Marshal
------------------

Lieutenant Marshal is responsible for all the mundane details like recording the bylaws, inviting people, and securing transportation. This title is given to whoever may have the second highest rank.

Vice Lieutenant Marshal
-----------------------

The Vice Lieutenant Marshal is the manager of the Punishments. They are responsible for the planning and implementing of Punishments. This title is given to whoever may have the third highest rank.

Prime Chancellor
----------------

Lead helper and supporter of the Death March. This title is granted to the person who helps out the most, but does not have enough rank to attain one of the first three titles.

Vanguard
--------

Vanguard of the Death March is given to the one who has the most seminal involvement in the formation of the Death March.

The Punishments
===============

Punishments are things one does to make the Death March more deadly. By participating in a punishment, you are conferred a title. The titles and specifics are listed below. It should be noted that no one has to perform the task stated, but they will not receive, or they will be stripped of, the corresponding title.

Personal Punishments
--------------------

Members may elect to take on personal punishments to show their devotion to the cause.

A single personal punishment will be approved by the Marshals at the end of a march. A second personal punishment will be approved by the members at the end of the March. Upon approval, the approved personal punishment becomes an Official Punishment for the next year. Those who participated in the personal punishment will be bestowed with a title decided by the remaining members.

Alcohol Consumption Punishment
------------------------------

The Protectorship of a Spanish-speaking Latin American country is the title received by consuming alcohol at some point on the march. Protectorship may be lost if one fails to (1) imbibe alcohol at some point on the march before touching the ocean, or (2) attend the most recent march at all. The unprotected country may then be assumed by another attendee.

Tommy's Chili Punishment
------------------------

Honorifics such as Sir, Doctor, Captain, Sama, Lady, and Master, among others, are applied based on the consumption of a chili-topped food product from Tommy's. Anyone who achieves this title and then misses a march is demoted to a Lord/Lady-in-waiting. If two consecutive marches are missed, this title will be stripped completely.

Squire (or other appropriate diminutive title) is applied to people who are deemed to have not fully earned their honorific. This can be due to not consuming enough chili-topped food product.

Labours Punishment
------------------

At the beginning of the March, all participants must draw five cards from an unmodified deck of standard playing cards. The values of these cards must be recorded in the order they are drawn. Face cards count for ten, and aces count for one or eleven, based on that person's preference. The values of these cards are used to determine how many Labours (repetitions of a given exercise, e.g. push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, etc.) must be Endured (performed) under certain circumstances (to be clarified at great length below). For each stop (scheduled or unscheduled, see below for details) at which Labours are to be Endured, a different Labour may be chosen by the person who is required to Endure, but the same Labor must be Endured for the duration of the stop. For example, Ace may chose to Endure push-ups at the Hub and sit-ups at Musch Camp, but he may not Endure half push-ups and half sit-ups at any one stop.

If at any time, any participant takes an unscheduled rest at a location along the route of the hike not preordained by the Officers of the Death March as an official, regularly scheduled rest stop, he or she must Endure Labours in order to receive the title of **Redeemer**. The number of Labours to be Endured is determined by the value of that participant's cards. However, only the value of the first card must be reached in order to achieve the title of Redeemer. For each card whose value is reached, a star is applied to that participant's title. If at any scheduled or unscheduled stop a participant with a title does not Endure at least his first card's worth of Labours, he or she is immediately stripped of his or her title.

**For example:** Ace draws a **5**, a **7**, a **9**, a **Jack** (10) and a **King** (10). If he makes an unscheduled stop, in order to achieve the title of Redeemer, he only needs to perform **five** repetitions, and he will receive one star. If he performs **twelve repetitions at a single unscheduled stop** (five plus seven), he earns two stars because he has Endured a number of Labours equal to the value of the **first two cards** in his queue. In order to achieve the maximum five-star rank, he must Endure **41 Labours**, the value of all of his entire queue, **all at a single stop** (stars are not cumulative, you can only earn a number of stars equal to the maximum number of cards whose value you have achieved at a single stop). At each successive stop, he must start over again from the beginning of his queue as it is recorded. Furthermore, if he does not complete the entire value of a card, he does not receive that card's star. So if he Endures only ten Labours, he only earns one star. On the bright side, once a participant has earned stars, he or she must only Endure his or her first card's value in Labours at each successive stop in order to *maintain* their current rank and title.

The title of Redeemer is also given to anyone who has been stripped of his or her title and has regained it on the same hike, even if he or she was previously a Saint.

If at any time, any participant stops to comfort or assist another participant who is making an unscheduled rest at a location along the route of the hike not preordained by the Officers of the Death March as an official, regularly scheduled rest stop, he or she must Endure Labours in order to receive the title of **Saint**. If this would-be Saint fails to Endure a number of Labours equal to at least the value of his or her first card, he or she must Endure Labours at the next regularly scheduled rest stop in order to receive a title, which in this case would be Redeemer. Additionally, any participant who makes no unscheduled stops but chooses to voluntarily Endure Labours at **every** regularly scheduled rest stop earns the title of Saint.

If at any unscheduled stop a participant with a title does not Endure at least his first card's worth of Labours, he or she is immediately stripped of his or her title. Additionally, any Saint who has earned his or her title at an unscheduled rest stop must Endure Labours at each successive regularly scheduled stop as well, but he or she may be demoted or stripped entirely of the title if he or she fails to Endure Labours at any future scheduled or unscheduled stop.

Once the title of Saint has been stripped, it cannot be regained until the next Death March, but it can be replaced with the Redeemer title on that same hike if Labours are Endured after the Saint title has been stripped.

Flagbearing Punishment
----------------------

Anyone who brings a large flag approved by the Grand Marshal and carries it for the duration of the march shall earn the Flagbearer title.

Vegetarianism Punishment
------------------------

Anyone who consumes vegetarian chili in lieu of the Tommy's Chili Punishment and does not eat meat for the entirety of the March shall earn membership into the Fraternity of an animal of their choice. This animal must be an animal that is normally bred for human consumption. The word used in the title for that animal should be a noble word rather than a common word. For example, rather than "pig" one could use "boar" or "Sus Scrofa."
